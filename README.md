Solution working with a web project from scratch enginering from the archetype to the UI. This solution is a monolithic based on MVC protocols, this technology was chosen since it does not interact with external elements or applications. The back-end has all the layers of a web project, and unit tests that were performed to validate the logic applied in the solution, the only layer that this project does not contain is the BD layer due to it works with logic of probabilities from each action (position) that are transformed into values. The base of the project was also made from scratch to have a clean use of the libraries selected for this solution, it is definitely not a recycled project, every code sheet, HTML, and configuration based on standards of web applications is new. The version of Java 1.8 was specifically used for the optimal management of Collections and the use of Lambdas. Maven was also used to manage libraries and code layers that allow the project to be opened and run in different IDEs and Application Servers. The use of primefaces solves Vista's Bean handling so that the data of the game board is maintained until the screen is refreshed, additionally it provides a responsive user interface since it manages control libraries and layout rearrangement.
